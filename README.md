# Heating Load Prediction 

The project is part of the learning by building the regression model section. The main objective of this project is to implement the regression method that we have been learned in the class. The specific goal of the project is to predict the heating load of residential buildings based on the following characteristics of the building: Relative compactness, Surface Area, Wall Area, Roof Area, Height, Orientation, Glazing Area, and Glazing Area Distribution. The prediction of the heat load is important to ensure energy-saving and improve system operation efficiency.

# Dataset Information 

The data was created by Angeliki Xifara (Civil/Structural Engineer) and was processed by Athanasios Tsanas (Oxford Centre for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, University of Oxford, UK). The data is collected from analysis utilizing 12 different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. The buildings differ concerning the compactness, the surface area, and the roof area, amongst other variables. The data set contains eight variables and two outcomes, denoted by Y1 and Y2. However, in this project, we only predict one outcome which is heating load (Y1). The link of data can be found in [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/energy+efficiency).
